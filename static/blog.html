									In this talk presented at TED Woman, she talks about the importance of women at workplaces. She presents startling facts about the current situation of workforce stating how women still constitute a very insignificant number in offices. In this talk, she doesn’t try to appeal emotionally but hits hard with the truth and encourages women to work. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Moreover, she doesn’t try to portray herself as the exception and accepts her shortcomings as well. She raised a very important and relevant point which poses a dilemma to many women at some time during their career - having to choose between their professional and personal lives. This talk is very motivating and teaches all of us to stand up for ourselves, not to be intimidated by others, and not to underestimate yourself. 
								</p>
								<p>
									She also tries to clear the notion that women have, which is ‘what I achieve is what I deserve and not a result of sheer luck’. She emphasizes on the statement 'don't leave before you leave'. This means that women should not start to plan to leave before they actually need to as this might hinder their performance and they might consider leaving earlier than planned. They should always stay and achieve so much that when they need to come back, they would want to come back.

								<br><span class="h6">- <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iamagambajaj">Agam Singh Bajaj</a> </span>
							</span><br><br>
							<span id="1small" class="blog-content-small lead" style="color: #555; ">
								Why do we turn to nonprofits, NGOs and governments to solve society's biggest problems? Michael Porter admits he's biased, as a business school professor, but he wants you to hear his case for letting business try to solve massive problems like climate change and access to water. Why? Because when business solves a problem, it makes a profit -- which lets that solution grow.
								<br><br>
							</span>
							<span id="1all" class="blog-content-all" style="display: none;">
								<p>
									Prof. Porter begins his talk by taking us through the various problems the world today suffers from. These include climate change, deforestation, poor nutrition, access to water, health care, food etc. What has changed throughout these years is the awareness of these problems at a global level.
								</p>
								<p>
									Porter tries to find a role for businesses in helping solve these problems. He begins by identifying and evaluating the current model for solving social problems which includes stakeholders like Non Government Organizations, Governments, Philanthropists, etc. who tend to provide solutions to these problems and businesses which are usually seen as the problem in most cases.
								</p>

								<p>
									Porter argues that with the help of all the solution structure that exists, we are making incremental progress and have been at these problems for far too long making only small progress. The fundamental problem in dealing with these challenges is the problem of scale.He identifies the problem behind inability to make a large scale impact as lack of resources. With the current model, there isn’t enough tax revenue, philanthropic donations, there isn’t enough money to deal with these problems at scale and hence we need to adapt and change the model to a profit generating mechanism. This is where businesses come in. The idea of “meeting needs at a profit” generates taxes, more donations and motivation to solve the problem too helping to deal with it at an infinite scale, sustainably.
								</p>

								<p>
									He goes on to to talk about how conventionally we have always thought of business profits and social problems are in a trade off situation which is driven by the greed of businesses to make more profits, causing social problems. However, Prof. Porter states that the opposite is actually true and businesses do not profit from social problems in any fundamental sense in fact it does so by solving these problems. This potential has been realized in the now and we see examples of businesses adapting themselves to be more innovative in impacting these social problems while drawing profits from it creating a Shared Value - addressing a social issue with a business model. Businesses need to change the way they see themselves and embrace this idea to enable others to change the way they see businesses. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Although I agree with Prof. Porter at many levels, I also have my inhibitions in thinking it can be taken as is. Idea of looking at a social problems as an opportunity for businesses to generate profits does aim at providing a well researched, well planned sustainable solution, however the costs to bear for the common person in exchange for these services has not been taken into consideration by Dr. Porter. Take for example the RO water purifiers that most of us take for granted in our households, is rather a luxury for a lower middle class or BPL household. 
								</p>

								<p>
									The idea of creating a Shared Value between social entities and businesses was an enlightening one for me since if both parties would value the same service then both would benefit from it as per how much they set their value as. This idea is not only good for the relationship between businesses and social entities but also between mankind and nature.
								</p>

								<p>
									In conclusion, I’d say Prof. Porter brings a fresh new perspective to business minded people who would want to do good for the world and stirs some great thoughts in our heads with his ideas worth sharing.

								<br><span class="h6">- <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gargi.guptaaa">Aravinda Kumaran</a> </span>
							</span><br><br>
							<span id="2small" class="blog-content-small lead" style="color: #555; ">
								Tim Doner shares his experience of learning many languages to illuminate the objectives of learning languages and how to reach the goals. 
								<br><br>
							</span>
							<span id="2all" class="blog-content-all" style="display: none;">

								<p>
									“If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.” - Nelson Mandela
								</p>

								<p>
									Timothy Doner, the teenage hyperpolyglot, begins his talk with a humorous dialogue between him and a talk show host which portrays the way in which Tim believed the media to be sensationalizing his story. Along with some laughs, this short act builds in our minds the base for understanding how a passion for languages and languages themselves are often misinterpreted. A line in which the talk show host asks Tim to speak in “Muslim” shows us just how oblivious people are of different parts of the world and different cultures.
								</p>

								<p>
									Tim proceeds to talk about how language learning should be seen as something that has been driven out of the need to understand foreign cultures and not as badge to be flaunted. He believes that rigidly structuring the process of language learning would cheapen what it means to know a language.
								</p>

								<p>
									Tim begins to draw a timeline of his journey. His first step was learning to break down sound and to pick up different speech patterns. He moves on to study languages at school but he confesses that he had never really been able to converse fluently at that point. He then talks about how he picked up Hebrew and Arabic and began to realize his passion for learning foreign languages. 
								</p>

								<p>
									He also talks about how the internet provides language learners with a new source of information and a platform to be able to connect with native speakers and also other who are learning the same languages. This then enables the person to get advice and tips from many people as well as to practice what they have learnt. And this has helped build a community of language learners.
								</p>

								<p>
									This combined with using different types of media and entertainment such as movies, books, music, etc provides the learner with a vast pool of resources that they can tap into at anytime to gather new information. 
								</p>

								<p>
									He also explains a couple of techniques which he uses to memorise vocabulary. He does this by giving short demonstrations. These techniques seem so effective yet so simple that they can’t fail to surprise anyone who is introduced to them.
								</p>

								<p>
									To Tim, learning languages is not just about memorizing vocabulary but about immersing yourself in the culture. He proves this by giving us different examples of the polite phrases used in different languages which do not translate to anything similar in English. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Tim ends on a rather serious note where he talks about how a language dies every two weeks and how this means the death of a culture and a way of living. Knowing a language is a lot more than being able to translate words or ask directions. But it is learning to see the world through the eyes of a culture that is not your own.
								</p>

								<p>
									“You can translate words easily. But you can’t quite translate meaning” - Timothy Doner
								</p>
